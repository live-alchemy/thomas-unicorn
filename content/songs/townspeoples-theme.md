*Part 1*

We are working, busy busy, left right

No time for fun, Must Get Shit Done!

*Part 2 (sung by Top Notch the town boss)*

Productive, and efficient

Proficient and constructive

*Part 3*

We cut down trees, to build the town

We only smile, we never frown

We're doing things, and making stuff

And we're quite sure, that it's enough
