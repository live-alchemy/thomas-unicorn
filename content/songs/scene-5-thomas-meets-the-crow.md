Scene 5: 

(Thomas comes on stage, it’s slightly different now, instead of a bridge, theres ... something to indicate crow’s nest. Walking and looking around, looks like they’ve been at it a while)



Thomas: If I was a crow, where would i be.. (thinking) well i could be anywhere. High in a tree, down on the ground, soaring through skies, or hopping around.... oh! what’s this? A black feather! I must be close now!  (Hunts around looking for more feathers)



(Meanwhile, we start to notice that crow is on stage, she is watching Thomas. Eyes narrow, suspicious. She won’t be found unless she wants to be.)



Thomas: (sighs, still no sign of crow or her nest) if i am in fact close, maybe the crow can hear me. 



Oh wise and powerful Crow! 

I come only with seeds of peace to grow.

I was sent by someone you know

But he didnt tell me where to go....



(Crow doesnt look like she’s going to reveal herself. Thomas is waiting. Engaging with their intuition, trying to decide where to go. Then a crow caws \*someone offstage\*, giving the crow away.)



Crow: (sighs) oh, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (talking to the crow), so you think they’re not so bad, do you? (Very gracefully comes down from where she was perched and comes to stand with Thomas) Who sent you?



Thomas: Hafiz did. My name is Thomas. It’s particularly urgent, wise Crow, I have come to this place to be of service to the healing of its people. And by now I  have seen it, there is a great misconception on the meaning of life. They are closed, alright. 



Crow: They are. (Her gaze makes Thomas feel rather unsettled, as if she’s looking right into them. Noticing this depth of sight, Thomas looks behind themself, wondering what was going on. There’s nothing there. Looks back at crow and carries on)



Thomas: Hafiz said you could help.



Crow: perhaps i could. But i wont. (Turns and begins to walk away)



Thomas: why not, crow?



Crow: (turns back to face thomas. Their innocence softens her). If you are new here, i can imagine your eagerness to change what has become the governing principles of this town. There is indeed a great sickness and it falls on many hearts. those with any sweetness left work to the bone with not a shred of life left to wonder. But the momentum, young friend, is great, and i am sorry to tell you, but it is a lost cause.  



Thomas: there is a way to change it, Crow! They still have hearts, and we must find the keys to unlock them. i think you are part of the key. 



Crow: Thomas, listen. I gave, and was betrayed. Such cruelty they can achieve when they are afraid. Now my loyalty rests with one, and if i keep her safe, my job is done.



 

(Both are silent for a few moments)



Thomas: who is she?



Crow: the keeper of the wood and the heart of the forest. 



Thomas: where does she live?



Crow: deep in the forest, amidst the wood folk and animals. The “darkness” as the town would say. They don’t go there. They’ve built their town to be lit, to be predictable and the wild places scare them. One instance where their fear is useful. As long as this tree is standing, she lives, and the world cannot be wholly lost to the ignorance it is plagued by. Within this tree is an ancient language with wisdom, not folly. Gifts of guidance and medicine, Fawna speaks this language. and i live for their protection.



Thomas: It is beautiful, a love like that. Do you go to see her?



Crow: I do.



Thomas: Will you take me with you?



Crow: No, young one, even as your innocence shines, I would not show anyone the way to that grove. They are well protected now, and we must keep it that way. Fawna is safe to hear the tree’s guidance and so stoke the fire that is the magic of this life. The town folk fear the dark and do not go to the forest. And I do not go to the town. (Crow turns around and over her shoulder says) Goodbye Thomas. 



(Crow exits, it is rather abrubt)

Thomas: (heart falls, but they are thinking, do not despair, walks off stage)
