Narrator:

A whistling through the wistful wood

Awakens subtle ears

A foretold astral uprising 

At last, on earth, is here.

 

Forces in the stars align

To set the Wild Love free

The humans are awakening

It’s time for them to see.

 

Theres nothing greater than the Love

That sings in every soul

*But pain can colour everything*

When fear doth take control

 

So beings from the stars arrive

And take a human form

They come to lift the consciousness

To heal the wounds and more

 

The celebration coming 

Is beyond our wildest dreams

The universe unfolds

And casts all doubt unto the sea
