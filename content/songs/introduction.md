Scene 1



(Begins in mystical tone. Spotlight on the narrator. As their poem finishes the lights come up the star being dimension)



Narrator: 

A whistling through the wistful wood

Awakens subtle ears

A foretold astral uprising 

At last, on earth, is here.



Forces in the stars align

To set the Wild Love free

The humans are awakening

It’s time for them to see.



There’s nothing greater than the Love

That sings in every soul

But pain will cover everything

When fear doth take control



Then humans see things differently

Lost to beauty, they become

a violent group, a passive troupe,

Forget the wise moon and the sun. 



So beings from the stars arrive

They take a human form

Come to lift the consciousness

To heal the wounds and more



The celebration coming 

Is beyond our wildest dreams

The universe unfolds

And casts all doubt unto the sea.





Whale Song

 

Whale and chorus : 



Love is coming now

In every heart the healing starts

When it comes allow

The waves of love are bigger than 

The fear that holds you down



Love is coming now

Recoil the anchors dropped in small caverns

brave the open sea  

You’re more than you could ever know

Set your wild heart free



(Enter Thomas and the Unicorn, best friends. Living and playing throughout the narrator’s next section. They are like one. Very close, moving together in polarity and in unity)





Narrator:

For one star being named Thomas

A journey will unfold

Down to earth they travel

For love’s message to be told



the journey takes them far from home

And a great loss does ensue

For as they leave the astral plane 

Their heart is torn in two.



Thomas’s heart is bound in love

With their twin, a unicorn

The two create one infinite spark

It’s the way that they were born



And they’ve always known this love, you see 

But Earth involves divide 

Humans have to choose to love

With free will, pick a side.



The deep descent down from the stars

Sweeps memory for a spell

The trip’s not for the faint of heart

But here tell: all shall be well.



The town where our dear Thomas lands

Is ruled by merciless fear

The hearts encaged, they wield their swords

At one who sees too clear



And though this wild adventure

Brings these friends so far away

Thomas and the unicorn

Will meet again some day.





Chorus (sings):

Though this wild adventure 

Brings our friends so far away

Thomas and the unicorn 

Will meet again someday.





(Narrator joins the star counsel. The star beings are having a meeting.)



Star Counselor:

 

We come together to address the suffering of our neighbours. The human world is on fire and we feel it. The wounding of one impacts us all and we send forward our capacity to help. They are scared and the violence grows as their fear does. They are hurting each other, destroying their home and dishonouring the (beauty)/ sacredness of life. They are lost in a powerless trance. 



To anyone called to the task, we ask to go to this world and dance. Help them relight the heart centred flame. Help them remember who they are and what they’re capable of. The great suffering on earth is our battle as well and to the same degree that the darkness has descended on their hearts, destroying their world, so too will the celebration that comes with their awakening be more than we have ever known.



(Thomas nervously steps forward)

Thomas: I am called. (The unicorn does not step forward. Thomas looks back.) Are you called, unicorn?



(A look of grave knowing comes across the unicorn’s face. They do not step forward and the counsel elder speaks)



Star Counselor:



The unicorn cannot go with you. Your journey to Earth requires you to know the separation that exists in that realm. The humans have free will and love is not inherent in the fabric of their world. If unicorn goes with you, you could both be lost, for the thickness of that place can make you forget who you are. Unicorn will stay and bring you back someday. And you will know the longing. But you will also know this love forever. It will call you back. 



Thomas:(looks pained, feeling the loss and still speaks with courage) I will go. 



(The star beings celebrate, hugging and sharing their love with Thomas. Exit gradually until all who are left are Thomas and the Unicorn.)



Unicorn: Remember me. I will speak to you through the smell of flowers and the birds who sing their praise to the morning. Be fearless in the fire of the unknown. Our love will shine no matter what, in radiant song between our hearts. Remember me. (They embrace and Thomas cries. Unicorn exits and Thomas continues to cry. Then gathers self and courage and sings)



Thomas: (singing)

There’s a storm inside my heart that brews

A thousand colours that paint with you

Oh what can I say as you go on your way

May light shine boldly and see us through

My teardrops think the best of you.... (the scene changes as Thomas travels to Earth, makes a sound of breaking - some kind of scream. Then silence. Peace)
