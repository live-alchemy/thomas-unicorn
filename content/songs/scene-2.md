Scene 2



(Thomas wakes up in a forest glade. Birds are singing, it is early morning. Does not remember how they got there, but at this moment, is taken by the freshness of the morning, the beauty of nature. Tanpura sound plays. Explores, hums the shire theme? Then sings the fool song)



Ooooo, o oh!

Trees sway to and fro

Speaking the names i once knew long ago

ooo oh, colours dance in my eyes

May sunlight kiss softly this earthly disguise

with my heart shining open i walk the unknown 

With my feet on the ground i am ready to go



(Continues to hum....then the Woodsman walks into the glade and Thomas jumps behind a tree. Tanpura fades.)



Thomas: I wonder who this bright star may be...



(Woodsman is gathering fallen branches into bundles, making kindling. Sees a squirrel or a bird and speaks to it)



Woodsman: Hello you, I brought the good stuff, same as usual. (Feeds the animals...) finds a particularly nice branch and sits down and starts carving. Sings to himself:)



In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings

Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven (bird sings, Woodsman looks and smiles. Continues singing)

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west

And my spirit is crying for leaving...

In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees

And the voices of those who stand looking (Thomas rustles and the woodsman looks over. Doesnt see Thomas. Thomas is playing a game of hide and seek).



(Thomas sneaking up on Woodsman, tiptoes, playful and exaggerated)And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune

Then the piper will lead us to reason (Thomas gets closer)

And a new day will dawn for those who stand long (right behind woodsman, standing tall)

And the forests will echo with laughter



(Thomas starts laughing behind woodsman. Woodsman swings his head around and yells, Thomas is laughing sweetly, finding joy in the game. Not concerned even as Woodsman is clearly surprised and concerned)



Woodsman: Who are you?



Thomas: well, I’m me! And I’m not. I’m the vastness of the universe. And a spec of dust. I’m the earth, and your dream, I’m the seen and unseen... I’m a fine carbon machine.....



Woodsman: Stop! I mean, what is your name?



Thomas: (pauses, curious, enters into silence and the names drops in.) My name is Thomas.



Woodsman: What are you doing here?



Thomas: im filling my lungs in the light morning sun, I’m smelling the fir tree, and feeling the birds’ glee, hearing the marvellous tunes, oh and I’m talking to you!



Woodsman: (shaking his head, bewildered) where did you come from?



Thomas: (pauses, contemplating..) I don’t know. 



Woodsman: you don’t know? Do you know how you got here?



Thomas: no, it seems I just woke up here.  



Woodsman: Well, that’s curious indeed, Thomas. I’m \_\_\_\_\_\__. It’s nice to meet you. (Holds out his hand. Thomas takes it, they shake.) I’m on my way to the market, but can i help you with anything first? 



Thomas: (pauses, thinks.) yes! Take me where the people’s hearts are closed. I need to find them. I want to help. 



Woodsman: (looks surprised) well there certainly are a lot of closed hearts around. Anywhere you go, you’ll find ‘em. They cut down these trees every day to fuel the fires of their ghastly goals, a man-made legacy to replace earth’s soul. There’s so much garbage in the way people live, and for all us who do give a shit, but aren’t calling the shots, we work till we’re broken, like it or not. I don’t know if you could even find a heart around here anymore.



Thomas: (looks shocked, hurt, amazed) Take me with you, then. To the market. I think thats where i need to go.



Woodsman: well, I’d say you're better off to stay and be a unicorn out here that go into the town, but if you want, i’m happy to show you the way. 



Thomas: Thank you! (They both gather their things, readying to leave) 



Woodsman: Hey, I’m sorry to ask, but are you a woman or a man?



Thomas: (pauses, find the answer). I’m neither. 

 

Woodsman: (accepts, though you can tell in his answer it’s unusual) Ok. Well, here, take some of my clothes, whatever you’ve got on there won’t go over well at the market... 



Thomas: (as they exit together) did you say unicorn? (Thomas changes before the next scene.)



(Another way to introduce the Unicorn prophecy subtly is that its a turn of phrase like “when hell freezes over” that people say. “When the unicorns come back”. Woodsman drops it when he’s talking about the locked up hearts and the townspeople. Thomas takes it literally, feeling the surge of love and memory, and the woodsman explains)
