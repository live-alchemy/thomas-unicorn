There's a feeling I get when I look to the west\
And my spirit is crying for leaving\
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees\
And the voices of those who stand looking

And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune\
Then the piper will lead us to reason\
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long\
And the forests will echo with laughter
