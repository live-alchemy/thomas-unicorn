Scene 4:



(Thomas re-enters the stage, now on the edge of town, outran the townspeople and notices a creek, water flowing. Stands by the water)



Thomas: oh yes! Oh water! I see you are flowing and bless this town of ill-reason with your healing caress. I offer you my song to hear and ask if you can show me the path most clear.



Water Song



What’s this! The waters can’t hear me! The pollution spilled so carelessly into this stream has hurt it, rendering it unable to sing, to talk to me. OH, i could scream! but don’t want to be found, but hear me, this isn’t right, we must save the waters....but oh now, who is this?



(Hafiz walks nonchalantly on stage, and Thomas hides)



Hafiz: (singing) 

“The earth has disappeared beneath my feet,

It fled from all my ecstasy,

Now like a singing air creature

I feel the Rose keep opening.



My heart turned to effulgent wings,

When has love not made one free?



(Hafiz dancing and singing, then becomes somber)



What do the dancing birds say

Looking down upon burnt meadows?

All that you think is rain is not.

Behind the veil Hafiz and the angels

Sometimes weep



Because eyes are rarely glad

And their beauty still too frightened

To unfurl a thousand swaying arms.



But like a radiant sky creature

Love keeps opening inside of me....”



(A group a children run onto the stage)

Children: Hafiz, Hafiz!



Hafiz: Oh, hello children. What are your hearts singing today?



Child 1: We want to hear a story. Will you tell us a story, Hafiz?



Hafiz: Oh I suppose I can think of something....

(The children are happy and sit around Hafiz on the ground who sits on a stump)



Child 2: It it true that you once sold your ears?



Hafiz: (laughs) It is true! I once had an ear that got sold to a fish. But first I must digress a bit...way beyond any logical sequence of events... we could start anywhere, with any word, in this fertile luminous world in which we live. What is the first letter of your alphabet?



Child 1: A!



Hafiz: O, that will be just fine. Art! the conversation between lovers. Art offers an opening for the heart, makes the divine silence in the soul break into applause. Art is, at last, the knowledge of where we are standing in this wonderland when we rip off all our clothes... 

(The children giggle)



Now, yes, about the ear. it is true. the moon once put a price on my head, it seems I had been telling too many secrets, giving away too much precious wine for free... so i bought a ticket for my eye upon that great sky bird that never touches the ground, and I bribed an ancient deep sea fish to buy my ear and drown. Now whenever love whispers, or even slightly moves I get a scouting report that most would pawn their hearts to know. Hafiz has become one of the greatest spies the world has ever seen. That is why the moon got rough, crowded all the heavens in a small jury box, knowing my case would be famous if i won..and i think love truly wanted my name to be known.. But for now this is the end, the essence in refrain, Art is the conversation between lovers.. now scoot, i hear the adults coming. 



(Children run off stage. Hafiz busies himself, over acting, a twinkle in his eye)



(Enter Town leader and henchman. They are looking for Thomas. Upon seeing that the sounds they heard were only Hafiz, they look disappointed). 

Town Leader: Oh it’s You! Forever idle in the afternoon, always a disappointment (mockingly bows).  



Hafiz: behold the town leader (mockingly bows back), and what is your hurry today?



Town leader: we are looking for a bona fide rebel rouser by the name of Thomas. Do you know anything?



Hafiz: Who me? No, sir, I know not of said shit disturber. Ive just been here by the river, holding the lion’s paw as i dance (57). 



Town leader: here he goes again...



Hafiz: I know of the falcon’s wings when they make love against the sky. And sometimes the sun and moon argue over who will tuck me in at night*...



Town leader: enough of your deranged digressions, Hafiz. If you haven’t seen him, then we’ve heard enough. I’d think you were in cahoots with this outlier if I thought you could tell your hat from your glove* (misty).



Hafiz: If you think I am having more fun than anyone on this planet, you are absolutely correct*. (Smiles) I remember you when you were young, and wanted to fly too..



Town leader:  Ha. Well I grew up, Hafiz, which is sadly something you may never do. Report to the town hall with your taxes next week or we’ll come after you.



Hafiz: You still don’t get it. Even after all this time, the sun never says to the earth, “you owe me”. Look what happens with a love like that, it lights up the whole sky.* (34) We are supposed to be generous (enter name), for what is this Earth if not generous? And are we not of the earth?



Townsleader: the people vote for me to protect them. From the wiles of the wild so that we are free and independent to make what we want of this life. 



Hafiz: and in your independence, you destroy the lands and pollute the waters, this is what you’d do with your freedom? When your eyes have found the strength to constantly speak to the world all that is most dear to your own life, then hafiz might vote for you* (175).



Town leader: I protect the people, Hafiz, that is my job.



Hafiz: your protect the exploiters and the rest are suffering. And soon we will all suffer when you have taken from the earth all that there is to give.



Townsleader: life is too short to waste with the likes of you. Let’s go (exits with henchman)



Hafiz: (clearly affected by the interaction dusts down his robes and takes a deep breath, sighing in release of the heated exhange) And do I dare ask, how you are finding your visit to our strange town, Thomas? (Hafiz’s eyes land on the place where Thomas hides as he says their name, smiles kindly)



(Thomas jumps, didn’t think Hafiz knew they were there. Collects themself and stands, stepping out from behind the bush to face Hafiz)



Thomas: if i am honest, I am confused. Because for all the magic that is here, I am not enjoying it at all. I am sick from the pain in this world. i am sick that the beauty of the earth and the heart is tread upon by greed and violence. I have come to help light the people’s hearts, to help them dance but I did not know it would be so grim.



Hafiz: There are benefits to being a fool. Awash on the side, out of step, out of line. If you’re nothing, you have nothing to lose.



Thomas: but the violence, Hafiz, they are slaughtering hearts, beauty betrayed, are there passageways out of this dark? 



Hafiz: (comes closer to Thomas and put an arm on their back/sits down something like that) the earth lifts its glass to the sun and light, light is poured. A bird comes and sits on a crystal rim and from my forest cave I hear singing, so i run to the edge of existence and join my soul in love. I have left that dark cave forever. My body is blended with love.* (49) 



And there is hope, 



See, admit something, everyone you see, you say to them, love me. Of course you do not do it out loud; otherwise someone would call the cops! Still though, think about this, this great pull in us to connect. Why not become the one who lives with a full moon in each eye that is always saying, with that sweet moon language, what every other eye in this world is dying to hear * (322).



Thomas: (looks thoughtful, feels their own heart). I remember being loved. I remember light alive in every aspect of existing, but it feels like just a dream now. I feel loss. Part of me is missing.



Hafiz: Indeed, a lover’s pain is like holding one’s breath too long in the middle of a vital performance, in the middle of one of creations favourite songs * (67)



When the words stop, and you can endure the silence that reveals your hearts pain of emptiness, or that great wrenching-sweet longing, that is the time to try and listen. *(143)



Thomas: thank you, hafiz.



Hafiz: And besides, you have me. I lay my wing as a bridge to you.* (49) But we’ll need more that just us to turn this wave around.  Go and meet the crow. She too lives in these woods, outcast. Almost no one has ever seen her. She is very powerful, but full of scorn for those who have done her harm. She lives almost exclusively alone save the company of the birds, the winds, and trees. Go now and tell the crow your plea. Perhaps she will hear your galaxy sing. Perhaps we will inspire the crow to take wing.
